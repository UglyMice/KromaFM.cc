# KromaFM.cc - Color Meets Music Swatch Tool

KromaFM.cc is an innovative passion-project web app that playfully fuses design and music. Built
with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (JSX) on a Vite-powered build system, it presents an interactive color
palette where each swatch is linked to a song title. Users click a color to discover its associated track—
turning color exploration into a musical experience. The project is showcased as a portfolio piece by a first-
time developer, emphasizing creativity and modern web techniques. KromaFM.cc targets employers,
designers, and music fans alike by combining intuitive UI with a fun synesthetic twist (many people
naturally “see” colors when hearing music 1
). In short, it’s like a Pantone palette with a playlist – a bright,
accessible tool that invites exploration and sharing.

## Features:

### Interactive Color Palette: 
A responsive grid of colorful swatches. Clicking a swatch reveals a
curated song title (and artist) for that hue. This turns the interface into a mini-discovery experience,
encouraging users to explore each color’s “sound.”
Curated Song Pairings: Each color is hand-picked to match a particular song. The design brief was
inspired by synesthesia, the sensory blend of color and sound 1
, making each palette entry feel
meaningful and memorable.

### Modern Tech Stack: 
Built with React (a popular open-source library for dynamic UI ) and JSX,
using Vite as a blazing-fast development environment 3
. This ensures smooth animations and
quick load times. Styles are crafted in CSS for a clean, mobile-friendly design.
Copy & Share Links: Users can copy the hex code or share the color-song pairing via a short URL.
This makes it easy to include KromaFM swatches in design inspiration boards or playlists.

### User-Friendly Design:
The interface uses clear typography (Roboto for headings, Helvetica for body)
and high-contrast swatches for readability. Overall branding is creative and fun, with a polished look
suitable for portfolios or social media.

## Tech Stack:
HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript form the foundation. React (created by Facebook) was
chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering 2
, making the UI code easy to
maintain. The development environment is powered by Vite, a next-generation build tool that offers instant
server start and hot-reloading for rapid iteration 3
. All song data and color info are managed in simple
JSON or stateful components. No backend server is needed – the app runs entirely in the browser.
