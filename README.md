# KromaFM.cc v1.0.0 - Where Color Meets Music

<strong>KromaFM.cc</strong> is a personal project that fuses design and music. It started as a simple way for me to learn React, JSX, and Vite, and has since developed into a creative tool with a broader vision. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on a Vite-powered build system, it presents an interactive color palette where each swatch is linked to a song title. The first version used a custom-built data array, and I'm now working toward integrating the Spotify API. From the start, I’ve aimed to make KromaFM.cc feel modern and minimal, while keeping it fun and explorative—see which colors correspond to your favorite songs, discover new music along the way, or recommend a color to add to the collection.

## Features:

### A Discovery Experience: 
Curated Song Pairings: Each color is thoughtfully selected to correspond with a specific song. Inspired by synesthesia—the natural blending of color and sound—each palette entry creates a memorable, meaningful connection between hue and music.

### Copy & Share Links: 
Users can copy any swatch’s hex code or generate a short URL for a color–song pairing. This makes it simple to include KromaFM entries in design inspiration boards or share favorite combinations with friends.

### User-Friendly Design:
KromaFM.cc features a minimalist, responsive layout that keeps the vibrant color swatches front and center. Clean typography and ample whitespace ensure easy readability, while a sticky header provides quick navigation. Whether on desktop or mobile, the interface stays uncluttered and intuitive.

## Tech Stack:
Front-end web app built with HTML5, CSS3, and modern JavaScript. It uses React for a modular, component-based structure and efficient rendering. Development is powered by Vite, enabling fast load times and instant updates during coding. All color and song data are handled in JSON or React state, with no backend server required—the app runs entirely in the browser.

## Installation & Running:

1. Clone the GitHub repo:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/KromaFM.cc.git <br>
2. Install dependencies: npm install (Vite, React, etc.) <br>
3. Run the development server: npm run dev. <br>
4. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to see the app live.

## 🚀 Planned Features

KromaFM.cc is just getting started. Here’s a look at what I’d love to bring to Version 2:

- 🔍 **Search Bar** — Quickly find swatches by color name, song title, or artist
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** — A sleek, low-light interface for night owls and late-night listeners
- 🎵 **Spotify Integration** — Preview songs and link directly to Spotify from each swatch

Have ideas? Let me know — I’d love to grow this with community input.
